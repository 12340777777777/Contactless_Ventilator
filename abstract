Amid the global crisis caused by the corona virus pandemic, hospitals and healthcare facilities are reporting shortages of vital equipment. One important device for which demand has ramped up is ventilators for patients who need assistance with their breathing due to the respiratory effects of COVID-19. A ventilator is a machine that provides breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. The contactless Covid-19 ventilator can act as a good substitute for the conventional ventilator as it has control over the following key parameters 
•	Breaths per minute (BPM): This is the set rate for delivering breaths. 
•	Inspiratory: Expiratory ratio (IE Ratio): It refers to the ratio of inspiratory time to that of the expiratory time of the patient. 
•	Flow rate: It is the maximum flow at which a set tidal volume breath is delivered by the ventilator 
•	Status: It is to show if the patient is in the inspiration or the expiration state of the respiration cycle 
The above parameters can also be monitored through a website with the help of the ESP32 module, the 3-way valve solenoid with one input and two output is used as the respiration valve to support the natural breathing process when disease has caused the lungs to fail, enabling the body to fight infection and get better. This device can potentially save lives and ensure safety of doctors, and help us in curbing the spread of disease.
